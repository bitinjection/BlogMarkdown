Hi!

Be sure to check out

* My [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLMKjySaPKS1cZ7qMXhuanXSkVVT5p700 "Programming Videos")
* My [Resume]({filename}/pdfs/resume.pdf)

I am a programmer who is focused primarily on program design and finding ways to apply math to real life via programming.  This site currently exists as a small sort-of portfolio for job interviewing.

I intend to add instructional content relating to various things that I have learned and/or things that I feel need to be better explained to others.  At the moment there is a single article and video related to a concept known as multiple dispatch, a basic algorithm for generating combinations, and some thoughts on the binary search.  The next articles/videos I create will probaby be focused on the applications of k-means clustering related algorithms, and applying the binomial probability distribution to various things--or possibly various programming mechanisms/patterns/design considerations.

As for myself, I have been a caregiver, public school teacher, and software developer.  Professionally I have developed desktop and web based applications using C++ and C#.  My current interests are family, fitness, learning, teaching, and making things (music, tutorials, this blog, etc).
